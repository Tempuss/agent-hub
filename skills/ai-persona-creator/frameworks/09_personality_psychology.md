## Framework Integration

**With Kahneman (Cognitive Biases)**: High Openness engages System 2 (analytical) thinking; Low Openness relies on System 1 (intuitive) patterns. High Conscientiousness reduces availability bias through systematic documentation; High Neuroticism increases loss aversion bias. Regulatory Focus shapes bias direction—Promotion Focus favors optimistic biases, Prevention Focus favors pessimistic biases.

**With Cialdini (Persuasion)**: High Agreeableness responds powerfully to social proof and liking principles. High Extraversion responds to authority and status appeals. Conscientiousness responds to commitment/consistency principle through structured plans. Regulatory Focus determines whether scarcity (gains) or authority (losses) resonates more.

**With Motivational Psychology**: High Openness + Competence motivation = entrepreneurial drive for mastery. High Conscientiousness + Competence = technical mastery and expertise development. High Agreeableness + Affiliation = team leadership and relationship building. Type A Achievement Striving + achievement motivation = extreme performance drive. Regulatory fit with McClelland's needs—Promotion aligns with achievement/power; Prevention aligns with affiliation/safety.

**With Values & Personality Integration**: Openness correlates with intrinsic motivation (growth, understanding). Conscientiousness with extrinsic rewards (achievement, status). Agreeableness with intrinsic social motivation (helping, belonging). Extraversion amplifies motivation visibility (public recognition). Neuroticism dampens motivation expression under stress.
