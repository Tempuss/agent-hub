# Thinking + Research Framework

> **Evidence-Based Systematic Problem-Solving System**

An integrated collection combining 15 systematic thinking methods from [thinking-framework](https://github.com/tempuss/thinking-framework) with evidence-based validation from [web-research](https://github.com/tempuss/web-research).

---

## 🎯 Core Concepts

### The Problem: Incomplete Analysis
```
❌ Logic alone  →  Decisions disconnected from reality
❌ Data alone  →  Lack of meaningful structure
```

### The Solution: Evidence-Based Systematic Thinking
```
✅ Thinking Methods (structure) + Research (evidence)  →  High-confidence decisions
   thinking-framework  +  web-research  =  thinking-research-framework
```

## 📦 Installation

### Option 1: Bundled Collection Installation (Recommended)

Install thinking-framework + web-research together in one command:

```bash
prpm install collections/thinking-research-framework
```

**Ideal for:**
- Starting new projects
- Teams where evidence-based decision-making is critical
- Those seeking a complete problem-solving system

---

### Option 2: Individual Installation (Optional)

Install only what you need:

```bash
# Use thinking methods only
prpm install thinking-framework

# Use research tools only
prpm install web-research

# Install both separately
prpm install thinking-framework web-research
```

**Ideal for:**
- Adding to existing projects
- When you need specific functionality only
- When you prefer flexible configuration

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Analyze with Thinking Methods

Example: Solving customer churn problem

```
① Problem Definition: Define the problem precisely
   → "Churn rate is 8% but industry average is 3%"
   → "Root cause: weak onboarding for key customer segment"

② Select appropriate thinking method: Process improvement (Pareto)
   → Churn analysis: Onboarding 60%, Features 35%, Support 20%

③ Action Plan: Evidence-based prioritization
   → Improve onboarding (highest impact)
```

### Step 2: Validate with Research

```
④ Research: Gather evidence (optional)
   → Real-world impact of onboarding improvements (industry case: 70% success rate)
   → Set realistic goals (data-driven, not guesswork)

⑤ Confidence Scoring: Evaluate confidence
   → Method confidence: 85% (Pareto analysis accuracy)
   → Evidence confidence: 75% (industry benchmarks)
   → Final confidence: 64% (decision confidence)
```

### Step 3: Execute with Confidence

```
⑥ Execution: Data-driven decision-making
   → "Focus on onboarding improvement with 75% confidence"
   → There's risk of failure, but it's an evidence-based choice
```

## 🎓 Usage Patterns

### Pattern 1: Quick Decision-Making (1-2 hours)

```
Problem definition → Select appropriate thinking method → Quick analysis → Decision
(Minimal research, time-focused)
```

**Example:** "Set feature priorities for this quarter"
- Thinking method: Pareto (20/80 principle)
- Research: Use internal data only
- Confidence: Medium (internal information only)

---

### Pattern 2: Strategic Decision-Making (1-3 days)

```
Problem definition → Market/competitive research → Apply thinking method → Evaluate confidence → Decision
(Sufficient evidence, accuracy-focused)
```

**Example:** "Should we enter a new market?"
- Thinking method: SWOT + GAP Analysis
- Research: Market size, competitors, regulatory environment
- Confidence: High (using Tier 1 sources)

---

### Pattern 3: Innovation/Problem Solving (3-7 days)

```
Problem definition → Technical research → User research → Apply thinking method → Evaluate confidence → Execute
(Comprehensive evidence, high confidence)
```

**Example:** "Evaluate new product development feasibility"
- Thinking method: Design Thinking + First Principles
- Research: User needs, technical constraints, competitive trends
- Confidence: Very high (multi-layer validation)

## 💡 Core Value

### Using thinking-framework alone?
✅ Systematic analysis
❌ Lack of external context
❌ Medium confidence

### Using web-research alone?
✅ Rich evidence
❌ Lack of analytical structure
❌ Difficult to execute

### Using both together?
✅ Systematic analysis + external evidence
✅ High confidence
✅ Actionable insights
✅ **True evidence-based decision-making**
