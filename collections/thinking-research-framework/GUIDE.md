## 🚀 5-Minute Quick Start

### Step 1: Problem Definition (5 minutes)

**Most critical step** - if you fail here, you waste all your time.

```
Q1: What is the exact problem? (distinguish symptom vs root cause)
Q2: Why is this a problem? (business impact)
Q3: What does success look like? (measurement criteria)
```

**Examples**:
- ❌ Problem: "Our app is slow"
- ✅ Problem: "User churn after onboarding is 8% (industry average 3%)"

### Step 2: Select Thinking Method (2 minutes)

Choose which method from thinking-framework to use:

| Situation | Recommended Method |
|-----------|---|
| "Why did this happen?" | 5 Why / Fishbone |
| "How can we innovate?" | SCAMPER / First Principles |
| "What's the strategy?" | SWOT / GAP Analysis |
| "How can we improve?" | Pareto / PDCA |
| "Need to decide quickly" | OODA Loop |

### Step 3: Apply Thinking Method (10-30 minutes)

Follow the step-by-step process of your chosen thinking method.
(See `reference/` directory for detailed guides for each method)

**Example - Pareto Analysis**:
```
1. Data collection: Categorize churn reasons
2. Sort by priority: Descending by impact
3. Apply 80/20 rule: Top 20% explain 80% of churn
4. Prioritize: Focus on top 2-3 reasons
```

### Step 4: Research Planning (Optional, 5-15 minutes)

If you want to increase confidence, gather evidence:

```
Q1: What information do we need?
Q2: Where are trustworthy sources?
Q3: How much time can we invest?
```

**Research Source Tiers**:
- **Tier 1 (90% confidence)**: Official documents, academic papers, government data
- **Tier 2 (70% confidence)**: Industry reports, expert articles, trusted media
- **Tier 3 (50% confidence)**: Community resources, user testimonials
- **Tier 4 (30% confidence)**: Social media, unverified sources

### Step 5: Calculate Confidence (5 minutes)

```
Confidence = Method Credibility × Evidence Quality

Example:
- Pareto analysis accuracy: 85% (well-proven method)
- Our collected evidence: 75% (mix of Tier 1-2 sources)
- Final confidence: 85% × 75% = 64%

Interpretation:
- 60% or above = Sufficiently trustworthy decision
- 70% or above = High-confidence decision
- 80% or above = Very high confidence
```

### Step 6: Execute (Keep Going)

```
With 64% confidence, focus on improving top 2 churn reasons
→ Measure actual impact with A/B testing
→ Refine next thinking cycle based on results
```

## 💡 Real-World Case Studies

### Case 1: Startup Funding Crisis

**Situation**: 3 months of runway left, path unclear

**Step 1 - Problem Definition**:
```
Problem: Not lack of cash, but "absence of clear revenue path"
Success metric: Achieve $50K MRR within 3 months
```

**Step 2 - Select Thinking Method**: SWOT + GAP Analysis

**Step 3 - SWOT Analysis**:
```
Strengths: Exceptional technology, passionate team
Weaknesses: No sales process, high burn rate
Opportunities: Market growing 40% annually
Threats: Well-funded competitors
```

**Step 4 - Research (Optional)**:
```
Q: What's the typical sales cycle for our market segment?
Q: What's competitors' GTM strategy?
Q: What partnership opportunities exist?

Sources: Industry reports, competitor analysis, industry conferences
```

**Step 5 - Calculate Confidence**:
```
- SWOT method credibility: 75% (well-structured but subjective)
- Evidence we collected: 80% (mix of Tier 1-2 sources, field experience)
- Final confidence: 75% × 80% = 60%

Conclusion: Sufficiently trustworthy strategy
```

**Step 6 - Execution Plan**:
```
1. Pilot 5 partnerships (60 days)
2. Raise bridge funding (45 days)
3. Build internal sales team (90 days)
```

### Case 2: Solving Customer Churn

**Situation**: Churn rate 8% (industry average 3%)

**Step 1 - Problem Definition**:
```
Problem: Heavy churn concentrated within 1 week of onboarding
Success metric: Reduce churn to 5% or below
```

**Step 2 - Select Thinking Method**: Pareto Analysis

**Step 3 - Data Analysis**:
```
Churn by reason:
- Onboarding difficulty: 450 (45%)
- Missing features: 280 (28%)
- Poor customer support: 120 (12%)
- Other: 150 (15%)

Apply 80/20:
Top 2 reasons = 73% of churn
→ Focus on onboarding + feature improvements
```

**Step 4 - Research**:
```
Q: What improvement results do other companies see from onboarding fixes?
Q: What are industry benchmarks?

Sources: Case studies, SaaS analysis reports
```

**Step 5 - Calculate Confidence**:
```
- Pareto accuracy: 90% (data-driven)
- Evidence credibility: 85% (multiple Tier 1-2 case studies)
- Final confidence: 90% × 85% = 76.5%

High confidence → Confident to invest
```

**Step 6 - Execution**:
```
Improve onboarding:
- Add video tutorials (2 weeks)
- Run live onboarding sessions (1 week)
- Provide example projects (3 weeks)

→ Measure after 3 weeks → Plan next steps based on results
```

## 📊 Confidence Score Calculation

### Calculation Formula

```
Confidence = Method Credibility × Evidence Quality × Contextual Fit
```

### Scoring Each Component

#### 1️⃣ Method Credibility

| Thinking Method | Credibility | Rationale |
|------|-------|------|
| 5 Why / Fishbone | 90% | Highly systematic, proven for decades |
| SWOT | 75% | Well-known but can be subjective |
| Pareto | 90% | Data-driven with statistical basis |
| SCAMPER | 80% | Stimulates creativity but scattered results |
| First Principles | 85% | Logical but time-consuming |
| OODA Loop | 85% | Proven in dynamic environments |

#### 2️⃣ Evidence Quality

**Score by Source Type**:
```
Tier 1 (Academic/Official): 90%
- Academic papers
- Government data
- Official company announcements

Tier 2 (Expert/Trusted Media): 70%
- Industry reports
- Articles by recognized experts
- Trusted publications/media

Tier 3 (Community): 50%
- User forums
- Blog posts
- Industry conference presentations

Tier 4 (Social/Unverified): 20%
- Twitter/social media
- Comment sections
- Unverified claims
```

**Averaging Multiple Sources**:
```
Example: 3 sources collected
- Academic paper: 90%
- Industry report: 70%
- Expert blog: 70%

Average evidence credibility = (90 + 70 + 70) / 3 = 76.7%
```

#### 3️⃣ Contextual Fit

```
100% = All conditions met
- Sufficient time
- Sufficient resources
- Problem type matches thinking method perfectly

70% = Some conditions not met
- Time limited but feasible
- Resource constraints present
- Problem mostly aligns

40% = Multiple conditions not met
- Time severely limited
- Minimal resources
- Problem partially aligns
```

### Confidence Interpretation

```
Final Confidence Score:

80% or higher: Very high confidence
- Execute major decisions with confidence
- Use for long-term strategy
- Justify large resource investment

60-79%: Medium-high confidence
- Reasonable to make decision
- Validate with MVP or pilot
- Implement progressively

40-59%: Medium confidence
- Direction is sound but uncertainty remains
- Test at small scale
- Identify information gaps and conduct additional research

0-39%: Low confidence
- Recommend delaying decision
- Need more research/information
- Consider expert consultation
```

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes and Solutions

### Mistake 1: Skipping Problem Definition

❌ **Symptom**:
```
"This is clearly a problem. Let me analyze it right now"
→ Conducted perfect analysis, but it wasn't the real problem
```

✅ **Solution**:
```
Invest 30-60 minutes in problem definition
- Distinguish symptom from root cause
- Interview stakeholders
- Define success criteria
```

### Mistake 2: Trusting Only Internal Confidence

❌ **Symptom**:
```
Analyzing only internal data (confidence 40%)
→ Decision disconnected from reality
```

✅ **Solution**:
```
Add Tier 1-2 external evidence
- Industry benchmarks
- Competitor case studies
- Expert resources
```

### Mistake 3: Misalignment Between Thinking Method and Problem Type

❌ **Symptom**:
```
Applying DMAIC to innovation problem (0% success rate)
→ Stifles creativity, produces no results
```

✅ **Solution**:
```
Match problem type with appropriate thinking method:
- Innovation → SCAMPER/First Principles
- Improvement → PDCA/Pareto
- Analysis → 5Why/Fishbone
```

### Mistake 4: Skipping Confidence Calculation

❌ **Symptom**:
```
"We analyzed it, now let's execute"
→ Wasted time and money on faulty assumptions
```

✅ **Solution**:
```
Use confidence score to determine execution scale:
- 80% or above: Full-scale execution
- 60-79%: MVP/Pilot
- Below 60%: Additional research needed
```
